# EIP1559 FEE Calculator

To everyone troubled by the gas fees on Polygon

## Overview

I have reimplemented Metamask's gas-fee-controller and provided a thin wrapper so that it can be called from various Web3 libraries.

Simply put, you can use the same gas fee calculation in Viem and Ethers as you do in Metamask.

## Installation

```bash
npm install eip1559-fee-calculator
```

## Usage

### Viem

```ts
